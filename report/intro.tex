\section{Introduction}
This project is based on \emph{A Bussiness Protocol} described in ~\cite{AbrialBook}. Essentially, we aim at constructing the model of a business protocol. This protocol determines the negotiation taking place between a buyer and a seller of an unspecified commodity. Both the buyer and seller begin in a certain state, and through exchange of messages, they move from one state to another. Also through messages, they try and negotiate the specifics of the transaction, and the protocol may eventually end in either a success (meaning that the negotiations have been successful)  or a failure (meaning that they haven't). The modeling is done using Event-B, and the model is implemented using Rodin ~\cite{AbrialBHHMV10}. We attempt to use \emph{Design Patterns} in Event-B, for the ease of modeling similar patterns used multiple times. In this report, we document the details of the project, including the Specifications document, the refinement strategies, and our experiences with using Event-B and Rodin during the course of this project.
